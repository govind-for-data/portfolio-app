            Yes, we are indeed cooking up some futuristic AI wizardry using HuggingFace, LangChain, LangGraph, and a handful of open-source models that make GPUs cry for mercy.

            Unfortunately, my current systems has the computational stamina of a potato, and Streamlit isn’t exactly designed to host Skynet. 
            So while the demo-worthy magic exists, you won’t see it running live here. 
            
            Till we figure out how we put the AI Agentic tools here, you can enjoy the other tools like Data Explorer and Pivot Builder.🍿""")
